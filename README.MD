# Amazon selling partner API generator

This project use Swagger codegen maven plugin for generate the model and api clients from the [amzn/selling-partner-api-models](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-models) github repository.

Some documentation at [automate-your-sp-api-calls-using-java-sdk site](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api-blog/docs/automate-your-sp-api-calls-using-java-sdk)

## Requirements

Assert that you have installed maven and git.

## Configuration

In the pox.xml, in the properties section, 


## Generation

Simple, run from command line 

    generate.sh

Then, as described in the documentation at the above link, the folder /amazon-sp-api-swagger-generator/target/amz-git-repo/clients/sellingpartner-api-aa-java contain the pom.xml and the java src files indispensable for the connecion to the api, more, in the folder /amazon-sp-api-swagger-generator/target/generated-sources/swagger, there are the sources generated by the swagger.

The pom.xml contains the necessary dependencies, then there are the various sources, which are made available by the amazon repository, in addition, the sources generated by swagger.

At this link [vidaniello/amazon-sp-api](https://github.com/vidaniello/amazon-sp-api), there is a project in which i'm going to manually copy all the files described above.

In the future I intend to create a maven plug-in that does all this automatically, in order to automate the update and release of the client package to connect to the amazon api.
